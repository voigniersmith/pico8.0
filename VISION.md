# Game Vision

## Core Feeling
Day: Hunt them down → Night: They hunt you → Survive until dawn

## Key Pillars
1. **Role Reversal** - Predator by day, prey by night
2. **Power Growth** - Steady progression makes you feel unstoppable
3. **Constant Momentum** - Always moving, no downtime
4. **Skill-Based Survival** - Your mistakes end the run, not a timer
5. **Simple Controls** - Move + maybe 1 button

## Design Principles
- **Clarity over complexity** - Player should instantly understand threats
- **Momentum over menus** - Minimize interruptions
- **Juice over realism** - Screen shake, particles, feedback
- **Tight scope** - PICO-8 constraints are features, not bugs

## Success Criteria
Does it feel good in the first 30 seconds of play?
