# Game Vision

## Core Feeling
Overwhelmed by enemies → Get stronger → Survive longer

## Key Pillars
1. **Overwhelming Enemies** - Screen full of threats
2. **Power Growth** - Steady progression makes you feel unstoppable
3. **Quick Runs** - 10-15 minute sessions
4. **Simple Controls** - Move + maybe 1 button
5. **Replayability** - "One more run" loop

## Design Principles
- **Clarity over complexity** - Player should instantly understand threats
- **Momentum over menus** - Minimize interruptions
- **Juice over realism** - Screen shake, particles, feedback
- **Tight scope** - PICO-8 constraints are features, not bugs

## Success Criteria
Does it feel good in the first 30 seconds of play?
